package com.example.twdist_android.features.auth.data.repository

// This file will manage all the data (domain) layer, therefore making the http requests and this kinda stuff
// This layer is not responsible for changing the logic of the UI, only the persistent data (db located) and requests
// This implements the AuthRepository interface and applies the logic needed for each method

// This layer will use the DTOs and the UserApi (property of the class that will be used for making the requests)
