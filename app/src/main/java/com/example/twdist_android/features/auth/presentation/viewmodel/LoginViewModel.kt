// These files will handle the logic of the screens (will handle all the on... events using the repository, mappers, etc.)
// Note that this file only defines the functions needed for handle the logic and it would then be
// implemeted in the LoginScreenWithViewModel.

// Example of content for this file:

/*
var formState by mutableStateOf(LoginFormState())
        private set

    // Would be called when user writes new username
    fun onUsernameChange(username: String) {
        formState = formState.copy(username = username)
    }

 */


// Check content of LoginScreenWithViewModel for implementation example
